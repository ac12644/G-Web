## About The Project

A collection ideated from the deepest dark side of the ether. Realised to contort the paradigm of NFT collections, to contribute the development and the growth of the NFT space.

Introducing G-Web: the metaverse's first car with 0xEmission.

Our intent is to provide a pixelated unique car for holders, granting them experiences in various layers of the metaverse. As our first goal, we plan to open our headquarters into Worldwide Webb's pixelated metaverse, by acquiring a large apartment.
